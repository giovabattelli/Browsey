# Browsey
Automate repetitive web tasks right from your own Chrome profile.

Browsey is a Chrome extension that drives your existing browser to perform routine actions for you. Use the dedicated Social Mode for hands-off social media workflows (e.g., engagement farming on [twitter](https://x.com)), or switch to General Mode for everyday automation across the web.

Here is a video of me using the web agent in social media mode, after tasking it with continuously scrolling on X and engaging with certain posts in a particular way. Don't mind the background edm music.

## Backend

Dependencies for the backend are managed with `uv` and the `backend/pyproject.toml` file.

### Installing Dependencies

Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
uv venv                   
source .venv/bin/activate 
uv sync                   
deactivate               
```

### Adding a New Dependency

To add a new dependency:

1.  Open `backend/pyproject.toml`.
2.  Add the new package to the `dependencies` list. For example, to add `requests`:
    ```toml
    # ...
    dependencies = [
        "fastapi[all]",
        "uvicorn",
        "requests"
    ]
    # ...
    ```
3.  Install the new dependency by running `uv sync` again:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    Alternatively, let `uv` handle both the install **and** the `pyproject.toml` update in one step (example):
    ```bash
    uv add requests
    ```

### Starting the Server

Before running the server (especially after a `git pull`), update dependencies inside the venv:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
deactivate
```

Then start the backend server from the backend directory:

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Extension

To start the Chrome extension development server, run the following commands from the root directory in a new terminal window:

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run dev
```
